#Here is the tutorial of those custom components
---
### For Toast

I only do one custom Toast, which have icons or not.You can also decide where to show in your activity. You can get this in the source.

### For Dialog

Like Toast, My Dialog also can carry icons or not. all the style can be decide by yourself. I think you will like it. :-)

### TimePicker

remember to use support library if your api older then 3.0. And the LayoutParent must be extends from FragmentActivity. So you can use the method of getSupportFragmentManager() and complete that.


### DatePicker 

Likes the TimePicker , the principle is the same . you can just use the Dialog to show(). That's fine.
